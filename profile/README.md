## Understanding Algorithmic (Algo) Trading

### 2.1 The Rise of Automated Trading
Algorithmic trading—often referred to as “algo trading”—is an advanced method of executing orders using automated and pre-programmed trading instructions based on variables such as price, timing, and volume. This process leverages mathematical models, historical market data, and real-time analytics to place trades at speeds and frequencies not possible for manual traders.

Over the last decade, algo trading has grown significantly in popularity in traditional financial markets, such as stocks and foreign exchange. In recent years, it has become increasingly prevalent in the cryptocurrency space as well. As digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) maintain 24/7 global markets, it’s no surprise that traders and developers are looking for efficient, automated solutions to capitalize on every opportunity.

### 2.2 Why Traditional Manual Trading Can Be Limiting
Manual trading often involves a great deal of emotional decision-making, which can lead to costly mistakes. Market FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) might push traders to buy high, while panic can drive them to sell low. A single emotional error can wipe out a significant portion of one’s trading account.

Moreover, manual trading is time-intensive. Cryptocurrency markets never sleep, and monitoring them continuously can be exhausting. A single individual cannot effectively keep track of market conditions across multiple exchanges around the clock. This is where an automated platform like UnTrade excels: it executes strategies with precision, operates 24/7, and removes the psychological pitfalls that often hamper manual traders.

Annual returns have reached **up to 708%** on certain strategies, and the 4-year cumulative ROI can be as high as **375,401.74%**—figures that manual trading rarely rivals. Many manual traders struggle to maintain emotional discipline, while an algo bot methodically sticks to its strategy.

### 10.1 Step 1: Get Invited
- **Secure an Invitation Code**  
  Invitation codes are limited. You can obtain one from current users, official community channels, or special promotions.

### 10.2 Step 2: Bind Your API
1. **Open a Funded Exchange Account**  
   For instance, if you’re using Binance, ensure you have funds available in your wallet.

## Referral Program and Earning Opportunities
UnTrade offers three robust referral and earning programs, each designed to reward users for spreading the word and helping the community grow. These programs include:

1. **Generation Income**  
2. **Trade Income**  
3. **Royalty Income**

### 11.1 Generation Income (Fixed Rewards Distribution)
**Generation Income** distributes fixed rewards based on the rank of the user in the referral chain. Each rank has a specific reward value, ranging from \$30 at Rank 1 to \$80 at Rank 10:

- **Rank 1**: \$30  
- **Rank 2**: \$40  
- **Rank 3**: \$45  
- **Rank 4**: \$50  
- **Rank 5**: \$55  
- **Rank 6**: \$60  
- **Rank 7**: \$65  
- **Rank 8**: \$70  
- **Rank 9**: \$75  
- **Rank 10**: \$80  

#### Distribution Mechanics
1. **Identify Referral Chain**  
   For example, User A (Rank 9) refers User B (Rank 5), who refers User C (Rank 3), who in turn refers User D (Rank 1).  
2. **Distribute Rewards Starting from Lowest Level**  
   If a user at Rank 3 is due \$45, that amount is allocated first. Then the next highest rank in the chain receives the remainder of their eligible amount, and so forth.  
3. **Stop Conditions**  
   Distribution stops if the next user in the chain has a lower rank, or if the max reward for that chain has already been allocated.

This ensures that each referrer in the chain receives a fair share, without over-distributing or missing any rank-based rewards.

#### Example
- **User C (Rank 3)** gets \$45, the full amount for Rank 3.  
- **User B (Rank 5)** then receives \$10 because the system has already allocated \$45 of the \$55 needed for Rank 5.  
- **User A (Rank 9)** can then receive \$20 (Rank 9 is due \$75 in total, but \$55 has already been distributed to lower ranks).

This structure aligns with the principle that higher ranks have greater earning potential but also share that potential with those below them.

### 11.2 Trade Income (20-Level Commission Distribution)
**Trade Income** is particularly appealing because it pays you a share of the **platform’s profit commission** on your referrals’ trades for up to **20 levels** deep.

#### How It Works
1. **Platform Commission**  
   UnTrade charges **30%** on the profits generated by its bots (a performance fee).  
2. **50% of That 30%**  
   This portion is then redistributed among the referral chain (the other 50% goes to UnTrade’s treasury).  
3. **Tiered Distribution**  
   - Level 1: 20% of that 50%  
   - Level 2: 10%  
   - Level 3 & 4: 7% each  
   - Level 5: 6%  
   - Level 6 to 10: 2% each  
   - Level 11 to 15: 2% each  
   - Level 16 to 20: 6% each  

Because trading can be ongoing and profitable every day, this can become a **substantial passive income stream** for those who actively build a network.

#### Example Flow
- **Level 1 (Direct Referral)**  
  If your direct referral makes \$1,000 profit, the platform charges \$300 (30%). \$150 (50%) is allocated for referral distribution. You earn 20% of \$150 = \$30.

- **Level 2 (Indirect Referral)**  
  Someone your direct referral brings in makes a profit. Part of the distribution goes to your direct referral, and you receive 10% of that 50% share, and so on.

This stacking effect continues down 20 levels, allowing leaders who build wide and deep networks to **scale their earning potential** dramatically.

### 11.3 Royalty Income (Monthly Subscription Revenue Sharing)
**Royalty Income** is a **premium earning program** that rewards leadership ranks with a share of UnTrade’s overall subscription revenue—across the entire platform, not just their personal referrals.

#### Key Points
- **20% of Monthly Subscription Revenue** is allocated to a Royalty Pool.  
- Distribution is **rank-based** starting from **Sapphire (Rank 2)** onward.  
- **Higher ranks** receive a larger percentage of this Royalty Pool.  
- Members of the same rank share that rank’s allocated percentage equally.

#### Example
1. **Total Monthly Revenue**  
   Suppose UnTrade generates \$22,500,000 in subscription fees (150,000 active users at \$150 each).  
2. **Royalty Pool (20%)**  
   This is \$4,500,000.  
3. **Rank-Wise Distribution**  
   - Sapphire (Rank 2) might get \$900,000 out of this. If there are 6,000 Sapphire members, each gets \$150.  
   - Crown Diamond (Rank 10) might get \$110,250. If there’s only one Crown Diamond, that single member gets \$110,250.

To **maintain eligibility**, members must meet certain monthly team and new member requirements. However, the reward for achieving and sustaining higher ranks can be substantial, as it’s derived from the entire platform’s success.

1. **Invest Only What They Can Afford to Lose**

   Spread your capital across multiple strategies and trading pairs.
